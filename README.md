GLTF Batch Exporter for Unreal Engine


GLTF Batch Exporter for Unreal Engine
This Python script allows you to batch export individual static mesh actors from your Unreal Engine map into .gltf format. Unlike Unreal's built-in export tools, which export all assets together as one file, this script exports each static mesh actor as a separate .gltf file. It's perfect for users who need to maintain the individuality of assets during the export process.

Features:
Exports all static mesh actors in the current level as individual .gltf files.
Customizable export folder path.
Automation for large-scale exports without manually exporting each asset.
Why Use This Script?:
Unreal Engine's built-in export tool exports everything as a single object, or you have to export one model at a time. This script solves that by allowing you to export every static mesh actor as separate files automatically.
It’s particularly useful for large projects with many static mesh assets, as it speeds up the export process and simplifies asset organization.
How to Use:
Set your custom export folder path in the script.
Run the script through Unreal’s Python console.
Each static mesh actor will be exported individually to your chosen directory in .gltf format.
This tool is ideal for developers working on large projects who need efficient, clean asset exporting. Whether you're preparing assets for external use or organizing your project, this script will save you time and frustration.

Feel free to modify this as needed, and you can attach it along with the script and instructions for a clear, professional presentation!
